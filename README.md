# Predicting sentiment from product reviews

In this notebook, we try to predict whether a product review has positive or negative sentiment using logistic regression.

We'll use a dataset of amazon baby products.

We'll work with text data and bag-of-word representations for feature extraction. A tf-idf model will also be implemented.
